            Wee bear's porridge was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right; and she liked it so well, that she ate it all up.
        </p>
Then Goldilocks went upstairs into the bed chamber and first she lay down upon the bed of the great, huge bear, and then she lay down upon the bed of the middle bear and finally she lay down upon the bed of the little, small wee bear, and that was just right.
